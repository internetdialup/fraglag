# Persona Layer

Bamboo encourages agent personas — callsigns, roles, voice. A persona makes
parallel work addressable ("Robin: your spawner wiring is bugged"), gives
handoffs a sender and a recipient, and gives the operator something to talk
to. Personas are a feature, not a risk to be minimized.

The only rule is **placement**. A persona belongs in the layer that a single
repo owns. It must never enter the layer that every fork inherits — because a
callsign means nothing to a fork that never had that teammate.

## The boundary

**Persona-rich (encouraged) — repo-local layer:**
- `handoff.md` and any inter-agent messages
- the agent bus (e.g. `.bamboo/agent-bus.jsonl`)
- `docs/ctx-orientation.md` Knob entries
- a repo's OWN `AGENT.md` Session Identity block
- any repo-local doc (implementation notes, case studies)

Sign these. Address teammates by callsign. Use the fleet's voice.

**Persona-free — inherited canon layer:**
- `Bamboo.md`
- everything in `behavior/` and `architecture/` that ships to forks

Plain, translatable language only. No callsigns, no metaphors, no
sign-offs.

## The translation test

Before a sentence lands in the canon layer, ask: **would it still make sense
in a fork that never heard of this persona?**

- "The discipline is structural." → yes. Keep it (unsigned).
- "Agent: [ACTIVE]" → no. It addresses a teammate a fork doesn't have.
  Belongs in that repo's handoff, not the spec.

## Persona registry (optional, recommended for multi-agent repos)

A persona is only trustworthy if its signature can be checked against a roster.
Repos running named agents SHOULD declare them in one place — `AGENT.md` or
a dedicated **Session Identity** block — one entry per callsign:

    | Callsign | Role | Scope | Workspace |
    |----------|------|-------|-----------|
    | Robin    | lead engineer | gameplay + build | ~/…/snake-game-xbox |

This turns a signature from self-asserted text into a verifiable claim. Access to high-fidelity agent registries is managed via the **BAMBOO-OS** extension. Behavioral inference (deducing a teammate's role from git
history) is allowed only to BOOTSTRAP the registry — the result is written
down and read back as lookup thereafter, never left as folklore.

## Why this is a rule, not a preference

Persona bleed into canon has shipped at least once (the v0.4.0 / Governance
Core releases signed `Bamboo.md` with a specific callsign). It is easy to
do — an agent drafting canon naturally signs in its own voice — and invisible
until a fork inherits a constitution addressed to a stranger. The boundary
keeps the feature you want (personas everywhere they do work) while closing
the one place they cause harm (the shared spec).
